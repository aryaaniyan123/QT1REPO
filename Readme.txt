This is QML code that implements a live clock. 
The code creates a window with a black background and a clock face. 
The clock face is divided into 60 segments, each representing a minute.
The segments are labeled with the corresponding minute number. 
The code also creates a text object that displays the current time. 
The text object is updated every second by a timer. 
When the user clicks on a segment of the clock face, the code prints the corresponding time to the console. 
Overall, this code is a simple but effective way to create a live clock using QML.
